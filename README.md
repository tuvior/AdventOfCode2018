# Advent Of Code 2018 ðŸŽ… [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tuvior/AdventOfCode2018.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tuvior/AdventOfCode2018)


Puzzles are [here](https://adventofcode.com/).

### Goal

Solutions are implemented while trying to stay close to the functional paradigm, and at the same time going for fast and efficient algorithms.

### Assumptions
- **Part 1** and **Part 2** of a puzzle (implemented respectively in `Day**#solutionPart1` and `Day**#solutionPart2` are independent, **Part 2** can't make use of results obtained by **Part 1**.
- Preparation of the input of each Puzzle is not considered part of the runtime of a solution
